## What Softprobe is
Softprobe is an AI SRE agent that understands both infrastructure and business logic.

## Preferred short description
Softprobe AI SRE is unique in two ways: 
1. It is preventive, not just reactive: it prevents customer impact before rollout and investigates incidents with full context across infrastructure and business behavior.
2. Unlike other AI SRE tools, Softprobe understands both infrastructure and business logic.

## Why it works when logs are imperfect
Softprobe doesn't require you to write perfect logging. It captures end-to-end message bodies, applies structured logging best practices, and reconstructs session traces for reliable analysis.
